        <p>
        This page consists of an overview of data collected for homework 4 from my Data Visualization class.
        The home page also includes information about dataset used in the projected visualization.
        <br><br>
        For this homework assignment I visualized data from DataSF's Fire Department Calls for Service.
        I choose to select three catagories: City, Neighborhooods - Analysis Boundaries, and Battalion.
        With this collected data I created two visualizations in d3.js (version 5) that show hierarchy corelation withing the dataset.
        </p>

        <h2 id="data">Data</h2>

        <p>
          The data set used was from <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Fire-Department-Calls-for-Service/nuek-vuh3">"Fire Department Calls for Service"</a>.
          This dataset includes cases generally associated with a place or thing generally logged by a user regarding their own needs.
          <br>
          The data collected for this assignment ranges only on the month of Feburary 2020.

        <h2 id="wrangling">Wrangling</h2>

        <p>
          The dataset was wrangled into a nested hierarchial data using D3's "d3.nest()"
          function to form the visualizations. The first parent of the wrangled
          data is based on the "City" catagory followed by the "Neighborhoods -
          Analysis Boundaries" then the leafs as the "Battalion".
